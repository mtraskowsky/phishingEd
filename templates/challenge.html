            <p class="email-info">Subject: campus power outage this morning</p>
            <p>We got an announcement at around 9:20 that Evergy will be shutting down power to campus
                at 9:30 for approximately two hours (probably already by the time you receive this).
                I have shut down all research computing in preparation for this. All core departmental
                systems will still be powered by the building generator and should stay online. However,
                network access to the building may be lost as the UPS batteries in networking closets run out.
                If you are connected to any departmental systems, you should close your files and log out
                as soon as possible so no data is lost.As soon as I hear that power has been restored,
                I will send another announcement.Stay warm!Seth-- </p>
